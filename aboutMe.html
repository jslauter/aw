                <h4 class="text-dark text-center my-4">I am a certified level 5 Romana Pilates instructor.</h4>
                
                    <div class="container text-center">
                    <p class="">My teacher training course (more than 700 hours) is the most demanding of all Pilates certifications out there. This training is your guarantee that I have mastered the classical Pilates method as created by Joseph Pilates. It is recognised in France by the FPMP (Fédération Professionnelle des métiers du Pilates).
    
                        I am also certified of the french certificate CQP Animateur Loisirs Sportif Activités Gymniques d’Entretien et d’Expression. </p>
                    </div>
               
                <h4 class="text-dark text-center my-4"><h4 class="text-dark text-center my-4">I believe in the Pilates method because it is established, effective, and recognised worldwide.</h1></h1>
                    <div class="container text-center">
                        <p class="">The Pilates method has proven its effectiveness for nearly a century (the first studio opened in 1926 in New York) with various audiences: the war wounded, wounded athletes, dancers, and nowadays the general public. The Pilates method is now even recommended by the medical world, particularly by physiotherapists and osteopaths, some of whom are trained in the method.
    
                            “My goal was to create a 100% dedicated Pilates studio where I can provide authentic expertise in this method and help my clients achieve tangible results on their physical fitness journey”</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4 class="text-dark text-center my-4">In another life, I wasn’t a Pilates teacher.</h4>
                    <div class="container text-center">
                        <p class="">I wasn’t always a Pilates teacher with lots of ideas in my head. I started my career in the event industry. Then, by chance, I fell into the world of advertising and stayed in it for several years as an account manager.</p>
                        <p>I had an established career. I was recognised for my work and had achieved my professional objectives. However, as my 40s started approaching, I started asking myself questions. This voice inside of me was pushing me to search for something else. 
        
                            I was always interested in personal development, and I’m not one to ignore my intuition. So I quickly turned my attention to what resonated with me: human connection, wellbeing, and sport.</p>
                        <p>And so the journey began. I researched, read many books and articles, and listened to countless podcasts to see what fundamentally spoke to my soul. Remarkable, creative, and passionate people inspired me on the way. For several months, I dedicated my spare time to finding a path that resonated with me and where I could see myself evolving.</p>
                        <p class="m-4">Eventually, I found it. </p>
                        <p>So there you have it – my journey in a nutshell! I hope it will make you want to meet me during a Pilates class so you can experience my very authentic version of the Pilates method.</p>
